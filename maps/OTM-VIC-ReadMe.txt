OpenTopoMap of Victoria, Australia with zoom levels 6-13 in the correct structure for Meshtastic UI.

INSTRUCTIONS:
NOTE: I recommend formatting your device's SD card in exFAT with an allocation unit size of 512 bytes before proceeding. This will reduce the amount of wasted space on the SD card, otherwise you could waste several GB and use 6GB instead of 2GB (for example).
The zip file has the correct folder structure already so just extract the contents onto the root directory of your device's SD card.

WARNING: Due to the extremely large number of small files this could take several hours to copy to the SD card, make sure you have the time.
The folder structure from the root directory should look like this: /maps/OTM-VIC/.... If the root directory doesn't contain the maps folder it won't work.

This also allows for other maps such as OSM-AUS to be placed in the maps folder.
